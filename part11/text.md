In modern web development with JavaScript and TypeScript, linting is mostly done with Eslint or Prettier. React component testing is done with Jest or Vitest and end-to-end testing with Cypress. Building the application is done with Webpack or Vite. I picked these because I have used all these tools during the Fullstackopen course and have had positive experiences with them. Most of these will work with other frameworks like Svelte. 

There are few alternatives to GitHub Actions and Jenkins, one of the most obvious one is GitLab. It offers familiar interface and features from GitHub. You can also use Azure Pipelines or Gitea Actions. My choice would be GitHub Actions because it’s easy to start with and you are most likely already hosting your repository at GitHub, so why not? It integrates nicely on the site.

I feel like the final testing before push should be done in cloud to avoid “works on my machine” type situations. Also, it’s less likely for tests to break from bad configuration like on developer’s local machine and waste their time solving it. For some personal projects local hosting might be fine, but GitHub Actions is easy and convenient to use, plus you get some free usage with it every month. I’ve heard you can host locally GitHub actions with “act” library (https://github.com/nektos/act) which is pretty cool since the syntax is pretty easy.
